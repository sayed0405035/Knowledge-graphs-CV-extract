Studying  mitosis,  he became  interested  in mitotic   spindles  and centrioles,  composed  of microtubules,  polymers  of the protein  ‘tubulin’,  and major   components  of the cytoskeleton  within  all cells.  Comparing  their lattice  structure  to Boolean  computer   matrices,  he proposed  that microtubules  were  the source  of biological  intelligence,  and perhaps   consciousness.  Choosing  an academic  career,  Hameroff  trained  in anesthesiology  at the new University  of  Arizona  Medical  Center  in Tucson,  mentored  by the department  of anesthesiology’s  founding  chair,  Dr.  Burnell  Brown  Jr, MD, PhD.  After  residency,  Hameroff  joined  the anesthesiol ogy faculty in  ,  a  position  he still holds  as emeritus    and practicing  anesthesiologist.    Hameroff’s  research  pursues  theory  - brain mechanisms of  consciousness,  memory,  anesthetic  action,  quantum   processing  in microtubules,  and clinical  appli cations  - transcranial  ultrasound (TUS) for various brain  disorders.

I have longstanding interests in climate vulnerability and adaptation; climate information provision and climate policy; international environmental policy; political ecology; and the interaction of global environmental change with food security.

I have longstanding interests in climate vulnerability and adaptation; climate information provision and climate policy; international environmental policy; political ecology; and the interaction of global environmental change with food security.  I take a geographical perspective on environmental change and its human dimensions in that I analyze the natural and social, institutional and behavioral, causes and consequences, of environmental issues, with particular attention to how change and impacts vary across space and within society. My regional interest is the Americas, especially Mexico.

I have longstanding interests in climate vulnerability and adaptation; climate information provision and climate policy; international environmental policy; political ecology; and the interaction of global environmental change with food security.

I have longstanding interests in climate vulnerability and adaptation; climate information provision and climate policy; international environmental policy; political ecology; and the interaction of global environmental change with food security.
